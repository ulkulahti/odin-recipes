                <li>8 ounces penne pasta</li>
                <li>2 italian chicken sausages</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>1 clove garlic, finely minced</li>
                <li>2 tablespoon butter</li>
                <li>12 ounces marinara sauce</li>
                <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
                <li>freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil,
                        add pasta and cook until tender with a bite.
                        Reserve about 1/4 cup pasta water;drain</li>
                    <li>Slice chicken sausages in half, the slice each
                        half into small bite-sized pieces</li>
                    <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat and
                        add sausage. Cook and stir until sausage is lightly
                        browned, about 3 minutes. Scrape up any browned bits
                        from the bottom of the skillet</li>
                    <li>Add butter and garlic to the skillet;cook until garlic
                        is fragrant, about 1 minute</li>
                    <li>Add marinara sauce and cream to the skillet.
                        Cook until combined and completely warmed through
                        Stir in pasta. If sauce is too thick, thin with a little
                        pasta water</li>
                    <li>Remove from heat and add in as much parmesan
                        as you like. Serven in bowls and enjoy with bread</li>        
                </ol>
